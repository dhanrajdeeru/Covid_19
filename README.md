COVID-19  VACCINATION IN INDIA
Overview :
	Using the datasets created by referring various sites it is possible to predict about the 
1.	Total number of confirmed cases
2.	Total number of recovered cases
3.	Total number of deaths
4.	Number of people vaccinated ( age wise , gender wise )
5.	Type of vaccination
6.	Total dosage administered
In India. Along with this we can also predict about each state wise situation in India. There is also
Machine learning model which is used to predict about the severity of  Covid_19 in India.

There are three parts in the project .
1.	Project1.py
2.	Project3.py
3.	Practice.py
Project1.py
	This file contains the entire project . So basically what it does is it gives information about 
1.	Total number of confirmed cases
2.	Total number of recovered cases
3.	Total number of deaths
4.	Number of people vaccinated ( age wise , gender wise )
5.	Type of vaccination
6.	Total dosage administered
In India. Along with this we can also predict about each state wise situation in India. There is also
Machine learning model which is used to predict about the severity of  Covid_19 in India.
Project3.py
	This deals with the details information about COVID-19 situation in each and every state of India and gives the detailed information about
1.	Total number of confirmed cases
2.	Total number of recovered cases
3.	Total number of deaths
4.	Number of people vaccinated ( age wise , gender wise )
5.	Type of vaccination
6.	Total dosage administered
Practice1.py 
	This part deals with the machine learning model . In this , a Logistic Regression model is created to predict the outcome . The feature set of the model are 
1.	Common symptoms
2.	Less common symptoms
3.	Severe symptoms  
4.	None
And the target set is Severity and it has four values
1.	Mild 
2.	Moderate
3.	None
4.	Severe 
 Execution :
	 Run project1.py file
